## POC for Legal Hackathon

This is intended as a POC for a legal tech hackathon. It was created on a weekend by Kevin Coyle 

This repo contains:
- A Python file that launches a Streamlit Dashboard
- A Pickle file. This is a trained Random Forest Model

The streamlit dashboard is a way to input variables into the RF model.
